## What is it all about?

The World's Largest Lobster is a concrete and reinforced steel statue by Canadian artist Winston Bronnum. The statue is 11 metres long and 5 metres tall, weighing 90 tonnes. The sculpture was commissioned by the Shediac Rotary Club as a tribute to the town's lobster fishing industry. The sculpture took three years to complete at a cost of $170,000. It attracts 500,000 visitors per year.
